# 100_Days_Code_Challenge
I will focus on DSA and development during this 100_Days_Code_Challenge. 

#  Rules to be follwed during 100_Days_Code_Challenge
1. I have to code continuously without breaking my work-streak for 100 days.
2. I will post about my daily work at the end of the day on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnshOjha12?t=tAMJCbV2CGzEDFW837R4cg&s=09) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ansh-ojha-b13060220) with the hashtag- #100Daysofproductivity or #100daysCodeChallenge.
3. It works similarly to Snapchat streaks , if I went out more than 2 days of unproductiveness, I‚Äôll have to start it again from day1.
4. Sundays can be taken as rest days or half days, but I will try to code on sunday to maintain my streak.
5. I will also update my daily work on logs.md to ensure that anyone can check my work.
6. I am requesting vistors to suggest or advice me to increase the productivity during the challenge.
7. If I ever have to take a break longer than a day (because of Sem Exams , sickness , etc). I will cover up for those days by adding 1 extra days to the challenge on top of covering up for that perticular .
8. I will also keep on updating in [Logs.md]().
