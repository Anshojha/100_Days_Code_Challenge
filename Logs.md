# Day 1
Today I created the repo to update and keep track of my learning.<br>
# Day 2
Today I studied about the STL in cpp 
- ## Day 3
 Today I attended an event in IIT madras which was one of the best experices till now in attending the events.<br>
 I also get the chance to meet and connect with so many talented and best people of the industry .<br>
 And also I got the chance to explore the lush green campus of iitm.<br>
 And at last I managed to code about Half an hour today and you can check [here](https://github.com/Anshojha/DataStructure_And_Algorithm/commit/a466227b1623149178c9a7db21a960d9383d0ba9)

 ## Day 4
 Today , I did coding for one hour and learned about STL(standered Template Library).<br>
 And Containers -: store objects and data. There are in total seven standards “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors <br>
- vector<br>
- list<br>
- deque<br>
- arrays<br>
- forward_list<br>
